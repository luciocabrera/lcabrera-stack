# @lcabrera/utils

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release.

  `@lcabrera/ui` ships React 19 components — Table, Form, Modal, Tooltip and the
  rest — styled with StyleX and built for React Router 7 loaders and actions.
  `@lcabrera/api` is the browser-safe fetch layer, `@lcabrera/server` the Node-only
  Postgres and crypto helpers, and `@lcabrera/utils` the pure helpers underneath
  both.

  These target one stack deliberately: React 19, React Router 7, StyleX, the React
  Compiler, and `pg` on the server. They are not framework-agnostic and do not try
  to be.

  `api`, `server` and `utils` are published as compiled `dist` with type
  declarations. `ui` ships TypeScript source on purpose — StyleX derives every
  custom-property name from the source path, so a consumer's own StyleX plugin has
  to compile it.
